    After forgoing his senior year, Olynyk was selected with the 13th overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 NBA draft; he was immediately traded to the Boston Celtics. He also represents the Canadian national team.
    </p><p>
    Olynyk played college basketball at Gonzaga from 2009 to 2013. He was mostly a bench player for the Bulldogs in his freshman and sophomore years, averaging around 12 to 13 minutes per game. In order to improve his game and get stronger, Gonzaga and Olynyk agreed that he would redshirt his junior year (2011-12), meaning he would practice with the team, but not play.
    </p><p>
    Olynyk returned to the Bulldogs lineup for the first game of the 2012-13 season, and had a great season, being selected as a Consensus First-Team All-American, as well as to the 2012-13 Academic All-America first team. Following his redshirt junior year, he opted for the NBA draft, thereby forgoing his senior year of eligibility (though by that time he had already received his bachelor's degree in accounting).
    </p><p>
    On August 14, 2019, the Miami HEAT announced that an MRI on Kelly Olynyk revealed a right knee bone bruise. The injury occurred on August 7 during Team Canada's win against Nigeria in an exhibition game in preparation for the FIBA World Cup.
